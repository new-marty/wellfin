### 01 — Product Vision

- **Purpose**: Help people make consistently better money decisions with minimal effort.
- **Core Idea**: Suggestions-first personal finance. The app doesn’t just show data; it proactively recommends next best actions aligned to a user’s goals and values (kakeibo-inspired).
- **Why now**: Data is abundant (bank, cards, Amazon, crypto). The gap is turning data into timely, personalized decisions users actually follow.

#### Value Proposition

- **Reduce cognitive load**: Turn complex transaction streams into a simple daily triage inbox.
- **Increase savings/investments**: Default-to-save nudges and goal-linked automation.
- **Cut waste**: Surface leaks (subscriptions, fees, price deltas), then one-tap actions.
- **Explainable**: Always show why a suggestion appeared and the expected impact.

#### Design Principles

- **Action over charts**: Every visualization suggests a decision.
- **Kakeibo framing**: Intents (Need / Want / Culture / Unexpected) first; categories second.
- **Swipe-first**: Fast triage → habit-forming loop (like clearing email inbox).
- **Personal by default**: Suggestions adapt to behavior, goals, seasonality.
- **Low friction, gentle friction**: Make good actions easy; add small speed bumps for harmful ones.
- **Trust & transparency**: Clear consent, reversible actions, privacy controls.
- **One number that matters**: Show **Safe‑to‑Spend** on Home (cash available + near‑term expected income − scheduled bills/minimums − planned savings).
- **Explainability**: Every suggestion exposes a compact “Why this?” panel with inputs and simple math.

#### Personas (MVP)

- **Busy Professional**: Time-poor, high-volume transactions; wants quick wins.
- **New Grad**: Building habits; needs guidance and defaults.
- **Side-Hustler**: Mixed personal/business; tagging and tax flags matter.

#### Success Metrics (examples)

- Weekly active sessions; % transactions triaged; suggestion acceptance rate; net savings delta; subscription churn reduced; “regret transactions” down; user-reported financial confidence up.
- **Day‑1 action rate** (accepted any suggestion in 24h)
- **Weekly Wants‑under‑cap %**
- **Savings‑rate delta MoM** (normalized for income variability)
