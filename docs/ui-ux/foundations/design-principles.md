# Design Principles

- Code-first UI: design directly in SwiftUI with mock data and deterministic previews.
- UX over scope: keep flows minimal; every screen has a clear primary action.
- Actionable data: visuals exist to drive a decision, not to decorate.
- Progressive disclosure: surface the next best action; let details unfold on demand.
- Accessibility by default: supports Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, color contrast, and motion reduction.
- Consistency: shared tokens (color, type, spacing) and patterns across screens.
- Reversibility and trust: actions are understandable, undoable, and transparent.
