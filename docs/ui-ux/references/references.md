### Evidence Appendix — Why our nudges work

- Suggestions-first, default-to-save: Defaults and present bias reduction → higher follow‑through
- Kakeibo intents: Externalizes values and plans → reduces mental accounting errors
- Just‑in‑time prompts (paydays, renewals): Increases salience → lowers procrastination
- Gentle friction on spree days: Temptation bundling and commitment → reduces overspending spikes
- Explainability (“Why this?”): Model transparency → trust and calibration; editable assumptions → user agency
- Money Rings: Immediate feedback loop → habit formation via streaks and closure cues
